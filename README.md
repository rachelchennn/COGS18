Repository for COGS18 Final Project

I created a Fish Fact Quiz for my COGS18 Final project. To initiate the quiz, download the zipped file, open the notebook, and follow the instructions provided.
All the functions used in the project are located in ffq_functions.py, and the tests for the functions are in ffq_tests.py.
The questions, hints, and additional statements for this quiz are located in ffq_req_inputs.py.
