# COGS18
Repository for COGS18 Final Project

I created a Fish Fact Quiz for my COGS18 Final project. To initiate the quiz, open the notebook, and follow the instructions provided.
The modules folder contains all the functions used in the project (ffq_functions.py), the tests for the functions (ffq_tests.py),
and the questions, hints, and additional statements for this quiz are (ffq_req_inputs.py).
#### Have fun!
